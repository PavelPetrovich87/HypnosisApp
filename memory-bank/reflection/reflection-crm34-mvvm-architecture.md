## ðŸš§ CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### 1. **TypeScript Compilation Complexity**
**Challenge**: Initial TypeScript compilation revealed 58 errors across multiple files.

**Root Causes**:
- Import/export mismatches between modules
- Type definition conflicts in index files
- Missing type imports for cross-module dependencies
- Incorrect type assertions in service layer

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Systematic Error Resolution**: Addressed errors in order of dependency
- **Import Strategy**: Fixed circular dependencies and missing imports
- **Type Consolidation**: Moved type exports to appropriate modules
- **Interface Refinement**: Simplified complex type definitions

**Lessons Learned**:
- TypeScript strict mode requires careful import/export management
- Index files need careful type organization to avoid conflicts
- Cross-module dependencies require explicit type imports

### 2. **Store Coordination Complexity**
**Challenge**: Coordinating between multiple domain-separated stores while maintaining clean separation.

**Root Causes**:
- Inter-store dependencies (Auth â†’ User â†’ Session)
- State synchronization across domains
- Avoiding circular dependencies
- Maintaining single source of truth

**Solutions Applied**:
- **ViewModel Coordination**: ViewModels handle cross-store operations
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Stores update independently with clear triggers
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected into ViewModels for coordination
- **State Normalization**: Each store maintains its own domain state

**Lessons Learned**:
- ViewModels are crucial for cross-domain coordination
- Clear dependency direction prevents circular references
- Event-driven architecture scales better than direct store coupling

### 3. **Error Handling Integration**
**Challenge**: Integrating layered error handling across stores, services, and ViewModels.

**Root Causes**:
- Multiple error handling patterns across layers
- Inconsistent error propagation
- User experience vs. developer experience balance
- Error context preservation

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Centralized ErrorService**: Single point for error handling logic
- **Context-Aware Handling**: Errors maintain context for appropriate handling
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to user-friendly messages
- **Developer Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging

**Lessons Learned**:
- Centralized error handling reduces inconsistency
- Context preservation is crucial for effective error recovery
- Balance between user experience and debugging information is key

### 4. **Network Resilience Implementation**
**Challenge**: Implementing robust offline/online state management with operation queuing.

**Root Causes**:
- Complex offline operation queuing logic
- Network status change handling
- Operation retry and failure management
- User feedback during offline operations

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Operation Queue**: Priority-based queue for offline operations
- **Network Monitoring**: Real-time network status tracking
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **User Feedback**: Clear offline state indicators and operation status

**Lessons Learned**:
- Offline-first architecture requires careful state management
- User feedback is crucial for offline operation transparency
- Retry logic must be intelligent to avoid overwhelming servers
