## 🚧 Challenges Encountered

### 1. **React Native Window API Compatibility**
**Challenge:**
- NetworkService was using `window.addEventListener` which doesn't exist in React Native
- Initial auto-initialization was running in both environments
- Error: `TypeError: window.addEventListener is not a function`

**Solution Applied:**
- Added environment detection logic
- Created separate initialization paths for web vs React Native
- Implemented safety checks before using window APIs
- Updated ServiceManager to handle React Native initialization

**Learning:**
- Always consider platform differences when using web APIs
- Environment detection is crucial for cross-platform compatibility
- Multiple safety layers prevent runtime errors

### 2. **Import Resolution Issues**
**Challenge:**
- Incorrectly imported `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for network detection
- Caused bundling errors: "Unable to resolve module"

**Solution Applied:**
- Removed incorrect import
- Documented proper NetInfo integration approach
- Used fallback network detection without external dependencies

**Learning:**
- Be careful with conditional imports in cross-platform code
- Document proper integration approaches for future reference
- Use fallback approaches when external dependencies aren't available

### 3. **Service Initialization Complexity**
**Challenge:**
- Auto-initialization was causing issues in React Native
- ServiceManager wasn't properly handling different environments
- Multiple initialization paths needed coordination

**Solution Applied:**
- Disabled auto-initialization in React Native
- Made ServiceManager explicitly initialize NetworkService
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Learning:**
- Service initialization needs careful environment consideration
- Explicit initialization is often better than auto-initialization
- Debug logging is essential for troubleshooting

## �� Key Insights and Lessons Learned

### 1. **Architecture Patterns**
**Insight:** The MVVM pattern with service layer integration worked exceptionally well
- **ViewModel Layer**: Perfect for coordinating between UI and services
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection
- **Adapter Pattern**: Easy swapping between mock and real implementations

**Application:** Continue using this pattern for future service integrations

### 2. **Error Handling Strategy**
**Insight:** Comprehensive error handling significantly improves user experience
- **Error Normalization**: Mapping technical errors to user-friendly messages
