## Task 2: CRM-33 - Implement Profile Basics UI Screen

- Description: Implement the basic profile UI screen for the hypnosis app, focusing on user profile display and basic interactions.
- Jira Issue: CRM-33 (Issue not accessible - implementing based on existing profile screens)
- Status: BUILD COMPLETE âœ…
- Complexity Level: 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- Priority: Medium

## Technology Stack
- Framework: React Native v0.79.6 with Expo v53.0.22
- Language: TypeScript (based on existing .tsx files)
- State Management: Zustand v5.0.8 (available but not used in existing profile screens)
- Navigation: Expo Router v5.1.5
- Additional: React v19.0.0

## Current State Analysis - COMPLETED
### Existing Profile Implementation
- **Main Profile Screen**: `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Comprehensive profile screen with:
  - User avatar display (emoji placeholder ðŸ‘¤)
  - User name and email display with verification badge
  - Session statistics (sessions: 12, total time: 4.2h, streak: 7 days)
  - Account section with navigation to edit profile, preferences, usage & quota
  - Goals section with chips (Reduce Stress, Better Sleep, Build Confidence)
  - Support section (Help & FAQ, Contact Support, Rate App)
  - Legal section (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
  - Logout functionality with confirmation dialog

- **Edit Profile Screen**: `app/edit-profile.tsx` - Detailed edit form with:
  - Header with Cancel/Save buttons and change tracking
  - Avatar section with change photo option
  - Form fields: Name, Email (with verification note)
  - Voice selection with 4 options (Sarah, David, Emma, Michael) and preview functionality
  - Account actions section (Change Password, Export Data, Delete Account)

### Design System Analysis
