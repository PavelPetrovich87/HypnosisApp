# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Awaiting Next Task**: CRM-34 (MVVM State Management Architecture) has been fully completed, implemented, reflected upon, and archived. Ready for the next task assignment.

## Previous Task Completed ✅
- **Task**: CRM-34 - MVVM State Management Architecture Implementation
- **Status**: COMPLETED ✅
- **Archive**: [CRM-34 MVVM Architecture Archive](/memory-bank/archive/archive-crm34-mvvm-architecture.md)
- **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Exceeds Requirements

## Project Foundation Established
### State Management Architecture
- **Domain-Separated Stores**: 5 Zustand stores implemented (Auth, User, Session, Playback, App)
- **Service Layer**: ErrorService and NetworkService implemented with layered error handling
- **ViewModel Layer**: AuthViewModel implemented with factory pattern for dependency injection
- **TypeScript Integration**: 100% type coverage with strict mode compliance

### Architecture Highlights
- **Performance Optimized**: Selective subscriptions, computed selectors, efficient updates
- **Mobile-First**: React Native compatibility with memory and bundle optimization
- **Offline Support**: Comprehensive offline/online state management with sync queues
- **Error Resilience**: Three-layer error handling with user-friendly recovery

## Current Project State
- MVVM architecture fully implemented and ready for UI integration
- Profile screens redesigned with Figma specifications (CRM-33 complete)
- Onboarding flow screens exist with comprehensive functionality
- Main app screens implemented with existing navigation
- Project structure established with Expo Router and TypeScript

## Development Environment
- React Native v0.79.6 with Expo v53.0.22
- TypeScript v5.1.6 (strict mode)
- Zustand v4.4.1 (state management)
- Modern folder structure with domain separation

## Ready for Next Steps
1. **UI Integration**: Connect existing screens to the new MVVM architecture
2. **Unit Testing**: Implement tests for ViewModels and services
3. **Feature Development**: Build new features on top of the solid architecture
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune state management for mobile devices

## Next Task Options
- UI integration with new MVVM architecture
- Additional ViewModels implementation (HomeViewModel, PlaybackViewModel)
- Unit testing implementation for existing architecture
- New feature development leveraging the MVVM foundation
