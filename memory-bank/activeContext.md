# Active Context

## Current Focus
**CRM-33 - Implement Profile Basics UI Screen**: Planning phase completed. Comprehensive implementation plan created with 5 phases covering design system alignment, state management integration, enhanced user experience, navigation integration, and testing.

## Active Task
- **Task**: CRM-33 - Implement Profile Basics UI Screen
- **Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE
- **Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- **Next Phase**: CREATIVE mode for UI/UX design enhancement

## Planning Phase Results
### Key Findings
- **Existing Implementation**: Comprehensive profile screens already exist with full functionality
- **Theme Inconsistency**: Profile screens use light theme while app style guide defines dark theme
- **State Management Gap**: No state management integration in current profile screens
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: Avatar management, goals interaction, statistics visualization

### Implementation Plan Overview
1. **Phase 1**: Design System Alignment (CREATIVE PHASE REQUIRED)
   - Dark theme migration from light theme
   - Component styling enhancement
   - Visual consistency improvements

2. **Phase 2**: State Management Integration
   - Profile store creation with Zustand
   - Profile service implementation
   - Profile ViewModel development

3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced User Experience
   - Interactive avatar management
   - Goals management system
   - Statistics visualization

4. **Phase 4**: Navigation and Integration
   - Deep linking implementation
   - Cross-screen data synchronization

5. **Phase 5**: Testing and Validation
   - Comprehensive testing strategy
   - UI/UX validation

## Recently Completed
- **Welcome Screen Implementation**: The initial welcome screen has been successfully implemented with a professional dark theme design. See [archive document](/memory-bank/archive/archive-welcome-screen.md).

## Current Project State
- Initial welcome screen implemented and archived
- Profile screens exist with comprehensive functionality but need theme alignment
- Basic project structure established with Expo Router
- Style guide created with dark theme color scheme and typography standards
- Ready for profile screen enhancement with dark theme implementation

## Profile Implementation Analysis - COMPLETED
### Existing Profile Screens
- **Main Profile**: `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Full-featured with user info, stats, navigation, goals, support, legal sections
- **Edit Profile**: `app/edit-profile.tsx` - Comprehensive edit form with voice selection, account actions
- **Current Features**: Avatar, name/email, verification, stats, logout, goals, preferences, support
- **Technology**: TypeScript, React Native, Expo Router

### Identified Enhancement Areas
- **Theme Migration**: Light theme â†’ Dark theme alignment with style guide
- **State Management**: Zustand integration for profile data
- **User Experience**: Interactive avatar, goals management, statistics visualization
- **Navigation**: Deep linking and cross-screen integration
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy implementation

## Development Environment Notes
- Expo CLI environment issue needs to be resolved for proper testing
- Project uses React Native with Expo framework
- TypeScript configuration confirmed (.tsx files present)
- Zustand v5.0.8 available for state management
- Modern component-based architecture established
- Dark theme with teal accents established as design foundation

## Next Steps
1. **CREATIVE Mode**: UI/UX design enhancement and dark theme implementation
2. **IMPLEMENT Mode**: State management integration and code implementation
3. **QA Mode**: Testing and validation
